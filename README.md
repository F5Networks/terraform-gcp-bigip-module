# Deploys BIG-IP in GCP Cloud

This Terraform module deploys N-nic F5 BIG-IP in Gcp cloud,and with module count feature we can also deploy multiple instances of BIG-IP.

## Prerequisites

Getting Started with the Google Provider ( <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started> )

This module is supported from Terraform 0.13 version onwards.

Below templates are tested and worked in the following version

Terraform v0.14.0

+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google v3.51.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v2.1.2
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v3.0.1
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.2.0

## Releases and Versioning

This module is supported in the following bigip and terraform version

| BIGIP version | Terraform 0.14 | Terraform 1.0.2 |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| BIG-IP 16.x   |        X       |       X         |
| BIG-IP 15.x   |        X       |       X         |
| BIG-IP 14.x   |        X       |       X         |

## Password Management

|:point_up: |By default bigip module will have random password setting to give dynamic password generation|
|----|---|

|:point_up: |Users Can explicitly provide password as input to Module using optional Variable "f5_password"|
|----|---|

|:point_up:  | To use Gcp secret manager ,we have to enable the variable "gcp_secret_manager_authentication" to true and supply the variables with secret name,version |
|-----|----|

## BYOL Licensing

This template uses PayGo BIG-IP image for the deployment (as default). If you would like to use BYOL licenses, then these following steps are needed:

1.Find available images/versions with "byol" in the name using Google gcloud:

```bash
 gcloud compute images list --project=f5-7626-networks-public | grep f5
        # example output...
        --snippet--
        f5-bigip-13-1-3-2-0-0-4-payg-best-1gbps-20191105210022
        f5-bigip-13-1-3-2-0-0-4-payg-best-200mbps-20191105210022
        f5-bigip-13-1-3-2-0-0-4-byol-all-modules-2slot-20191105200157
        ...and some more
        f5-bigip-14-1-2-3-0-0-5-byol-ltm-1boot-loc-191218142225
        f5-bigip-15-1-2-1-0-0-10-payg-best-1gbps-210115161130
        f5-bigip-15-1-2-1-0-0-10-byol-ltm-2boot-loc-210115160742
        ...and more...
```

2.In the "variables.tf", modify image_name with the image name from gcloud CLI results

```bash
        # BIGIP Image
        variable image_name { default = "projects/f5-7626-networks-public/global/images/f5-bigip-15-1-2-1-0-0-10-byol-ltm-2boot-loc-210115160742" }
```

3.Add the corresponding license key in DO declaration( Declarative Onboarding ), this DO can be in custom run-time-int script or outside of it.
   ( <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/bigip-examples.html#standalone-declaration> )

```bash
         "myLicense": {
          "class": "License",
          "licenseType": "regKey",
          "regKey": "${regKey}"
      },
```

## Custom User data && Metadata

+ By default `custom_user_data` will be `null`,this module will use default [startup-script.tpl](https://github.com/F5Networks/terraform-gcp-bigip-module/blob/main/startup-script.tpl) file contents for initial BIGIP onboard connfiguration

+ If users desire custom onboard configuration,we can use this variable and pass contents of custom script to the `custom_user_data` variable to have custom onboard bigip configuration. ( An example is provided in examples section [custom_user_data](https://github.com/F5Networks/terraform-gcp-bigip-module/tree/main/examples/bigip_gcp_1nic_deploy_custom_runtime_init))

+ `custom_user_data` script is composed of bash,tmsh and Runtime init yaml file. details of [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init)

~> **Note:** When user is having `custom_user_data` script, BIG-IP onboard config (like setting users accounts,password setting and additional initial config) completely depends on `custom_user_data` script.

### Example 3-NIC deployment with custom_user_data script

```hcl
module bigip {
  count               = var.instance_count
  source              = "F5Networks/bigip-module/gcp"
  prefix              = "bigip-gcp-3nic"
  project_id          = var.project_id
  zone                = var.zone
  image               = var.image
  service_account     = var.service_account
  mgmt_subnet_ids     = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.mgmt_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  external_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.external_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  internal_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.internal_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = false, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  custom_user_data       = var.custom_user_data
}
```

+ variable metadata can be used as set of key:value pairs for the instance with or without custom_user_data as shown below

```hcl
module "bigip" {
   ...
   # Onboard through cloud-config YAML and allow connection to serial port
  metadata = {
    user-data = var.cloud_config_yaml
    serial-port-enable = "TRUE"
  }
  
  # Override the module startup-script as everything is in cloud-config YAML
  custom_user_data = <<-EOS
#!/bin/sh
exit 0
EOS
}
```

### Example Usage

We have provided some common deployment [examples](https://github.com/F5Networks/terraform-gcp-bigip-module/tree/main/examples)

~> **Note:** Users can have dynamic or static private ip allocation.If primary/secondary private ip value is null, it will be dynamic or else static private ip allocation.

~> **Note:** With Static private ip allocation we can assign primary and secondary private ips for external interfaces, whereas primary private ip for management and internal interfaces.

If it is static private ip allocation we can't use module count as same private ips will be tried to allocate for multiple
bigip instances based on module count.

With Dynamic private ip allocation,we have to pass null value to primary/secondary private ip declaration and module count will be supported.

~>**NOTE:** If you are using custom ATC tools, don't change name of ATC tools rpm file( ex: f5-declarative-onboarding-xxxx.noarch.rpm,f5-appsvcs-xxx.noarch.rpm)

Below example snippets show how this module is called. ( Dynamic private ip allocation )

```hcl
#Example 1-NIC Deployment Module usage
module bigip {
  count           = var.instance_count
  source          = "F5Networks/bigip-module/gcp"
  prefix          = "bigip-gcp-1nic"
  project_id      = var.project_id
  zone            = var.zone
  image           = var.image
  service_account = var.service_account
  mgmt_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.mgmt_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
}

#Example 2-NIC Deployment Module usage

module "bigip" {
  count               = var.instance_count
  source              = "F5Networks/bigip-module/gcp"
  prefix              = "bigip-gcp-2nic"
  project_id          = var.project_id
  zone                = var.zone
  image               = var.image
  service_account     = var.service_account
  mgmt_subnet_ids     = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.mgmt_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  external_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.external_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
}

#Example 3-NIC Deployment  Module usage 

module bigip {
  count               = var.instance_count
  source              = "F5Networks/bigip-module/gcp"
  prefix              = "bigip-gcp-3nic"
  project_id          = var.project_id
  zone                = var.zone
  image               = var.image
  service_account     = var.service_account
  mgmt_subnet_ids     = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.mgmt_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  external_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.external_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  internal_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.internal_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = false, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
}

#Example 4-NIC Deployment  Module usage(with 2 external public interfaces,one management and internal interfaces)

module bigip {
  count               = var.instance_count
  source              = "F5Networks/bigip-module/gcp"
  prefix              = "bigip-gcp-4nic"
  project_id          = var.project_id
  zone                = var.zone
  image               = var.image
  service_account     = var.service_account
  mgmt_subnet_ids     = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.mgmt_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  external_subnet_ids = ([{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.external_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = ""  },                                         { "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.external_subnetwork2.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = ""  }])
  internal_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.internal_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = false, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
}
```

~>**NOTE:** Similarly we can have N-nic deployments based on user provided subnet_ids. With module count, user can deploy multiple bigip instances in the gcp cloud (with the default value of count being one )

### Below is the example snippet for private ip allocation

```hcl
#Example 3-NIC Deployment with static private ip allocation
module bigip {
  count               = var.instance_count
  source              = "F5Networks/bigip-module/gcp"
  prefix              = "bigip-gcp-3nic"
  project_id          = var.project_id
  zone                = var.zone
  image               = var.image
  service_account     = var.service_account
  mgmt_subnet_ids     = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.mgmt_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  external_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.external_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "10.2.1.2", "private_ip_secondary" = "10.2.1.3" }]
  internal_subnet_ids = [{ "subnet_id" = google_compute_subnetwork.internal_subnetwork.id, "public_ip" = false, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
}
```
